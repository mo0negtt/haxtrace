# FAQs

### What is Dripzels?

Dripzels is a web app with several Roblox tools. Its main feature lets you preview your clothing designs on a 3D dummy before uploading, so you don't waste 10 Robux on mistakes. It can also convert advanced templates, make 2D previews for ads or sharing, and calculate Robux and DevEx pricing.

### Does Dripzels store my clothing?

No. No clothing data is stored unless you choose to share it. Shared clothing are automatically deleted 48 hours at longest.

### Is Dripzels free?

Yes. Dripzels is free and will always remain free. If you wish to support me you can donate any amount at my [Ko-Fi Page](https://ko-fi.com/dripzels)

### Does Dripzels bring down quality?

No. Clothing might appear blurry on the humanoid - that is because of how 3D programs interpolate the textures (your clothing). The interpolation can be either linear (blurry) or closest (pixelated), Roblox uses linear interpolation. Dripzels uses linear interpolation too.
